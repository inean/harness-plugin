## Where to Look First

| Task              | Start here                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Architecture overview | ARCHITECTURE.md (root)    |
| Layer rules       | docs/architecture/LAYERS.md   |
| Migration status  | docs/exec-plans/active/harness-migration-map.md |
| {common task 1}   | {directory/file}              |
| {common task 2}   | {directory/file}              |
| {common task 3}   | {directory/file}              |

## Constraints (Machine-Readable)

- MUST: {hard rule with pointer to enforcement}
- MUST NOT: {prohibition with pointer to LAYERS.md}
- PREFER: {soft preference}
- VERIFY: {knowledge_base_check} && {verification command before PR}
